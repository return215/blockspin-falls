# 01: Unpack

Well, here we are. Primp Town. Probably just an average town you would find in some countries. There is a town hall, library, museum, plaza, and school (we'll get to that one in a few days. One thing that strikes me the most is the repetitive appearance of a round object with eyes. I guess that is some kind of a signature thing in this area.

Also I noticed for a few seconds in the plaza that something is going on. Two people standing behind a board where those round objects fall from above their heads.
